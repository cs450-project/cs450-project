# CS 450 Project: Financial Management System

The team [`Slack` workspace](inigo-montoya.slack.com)

## Frontend
Frontend is written in [Vue](www.vuejs.org).
[`vue-cli`](https://cli.vuejs.org) is recommended, but not required!

To run the frontend open a terminal inside of the `frontend/` directory and run
`$ npm run serve`

For help with Vue:
1. Check the [docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)
2. Ask Alex on Slack

(in that order)

## Backend
```php
<?php
    echo '2004 called. They want their server side language back';
?>
```
